  <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
  <p>
    The EU Grant Playbook 2025 is a hands-on roadmap that moves deep-tech companies from TRL 4‚Äì5 prototypes to TRL 8, market-ready products in just 24 months. Built for founders, researchers, and grant managers‚Äînot for evaluators‚Äîit converts Brussels' dense rulebooks into a focused, 90-day writing sprint that consistently wins funding.
  </p>
  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Up to 78% effective reimbursement.</b> Innovation-Action grants typically cover 70% of direct costs plus a 25% overhead uplift on most salary and ODC lines, shrinking the cash a company must supply.</li>
    <li><b>Non-dilutive capital at scale.</b> Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, LIFE, PRIMA, Women's Leadership, and STEP can deliver ‚Ç¨50k‚Äì‚Ç¨30m per project; EIC Accelerator adds equity for TRL 8‚Äì9 scale-up.</li>
    <li><b>Competitive edge.</b> Proposals that nail IP freedom-to-operate, gender balance in senior roles, and a quantified go-to-market plan score up to 1.5 points higher in Impact and Implementation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why partner with a professional grant team</h2>
  <p>
    Companies that use our end-to-end Grant Architecture service have 45% higher chances of success compared to companies that submit alone (vs. &lt;17% average), avoid compliance pitfalls, and free engineers to focus on R&amp;D while we handle call selection, storyboarding, full drafting, red-team rehearsals, and portal upload.
  </p>
  <h2>Expected payoff</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clears every eligibility macro on the EU portal the first time.</li>
    <li>Demonstrates a clear TRL 4‚Üí8 maturation path, backed by a market-entry strategy, budget optimized for overhead, and proof of 30% co-funding.</li>
    <li>Positions your company to receive grant cash in the bank within 30 days of Grant Agreement signature‚Äîand to hit the market with TRL 8 hardware or software inside two years.</li>
    <li>Exposure to EU approved investors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Quick Start: Eligibility &amp; Glossary</h1>
  <h2>Why read this chapter?</h2>
  <p>
    In less than ten minutes you will know exactly whether Brussels classifies your organisation as fully fundable, partially fundable or "bring‚Äëyour‚Äëown‚Äëbudget." You will also walk away with a new Participant Identification Code (PIC) and a pocket‚Äësized glossary so call texts no longer feel like cryptic crossword clues.
  </p>
  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    For many first‚Äëtimers the most paralysing moment arrives before a single line is written: "Are we even allowed to apply?" The eligibility maze looks intimidating because it mixes geography, legal status and sometimes even project type. One partner may sit in an Associated Country, another in a low‚Äëincome economy that qualifies for automatic EU support, while a third‚Äîperhaps from the United States‚Äîmust prove self‚Äëfinancing.

  <h3>How to confirm eligibility in three practical moves</h3>
  <div class="steps-mint">
    <h4 class="mint-step">Step 1 ‚Äì Run the country test</h4>
    Start with your registered head‚Äëoffice address, not the nationality of individual founders. If that address sits inside the EU‚Äë27 or in an Associated Country‚Äîthink Israel, the United Kingdom or Switzerland after January 2025‚Äîyou automatically qualify for Horizon Europe money.
    <h4 class="mint-step">Step 2 ‚Äì Secure your PIC before doing anything else</h4>
    Every legal entity must hold a Participant Identification Code to unlock the Funding &amp; Tenders forms. The process is simpler than a social‚Äëmedia signup: create an EU Login, choose "Organisation Registration," upload either a VAT certificate or company registry extract and wait for the portal to spit out a nine‚Äëdigit code.
    <h4 class="mint-step">Step 3 ‚Äì Learn six unavoidable acronyms</h4>
    WP, RIA or IA, Grant Agreement (GA), PIC, Seal of Excellence (SoE) and Technology Readiness Level (TRL). These six shortcuts appear dozens of times in every call document. Think of them as your sat‚Äënav vocabulary; misreading even one will steer you to the wrong destination.
  </div>
  <div class="playbook-summary">
    <b>Evaluator Insight:</b>
    One in twenty proposals fails the first screening because a well‚Äëknown company from a high‚Äëincome third country assumed it would be funded. The consortium scored zero on "Quality and efficiency of implementation" even though the science was excellent.
  </div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Acronym</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Why it matters</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>WP</td><td>Work Packages</td><td>Detailed breakdown of project activities</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Milestone</td><td>Project Milestone</td><td>Output of a task in a work package</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Deliverables</td><td>Project Deliverables</td><td>Checkpoints produced at a specific point in a task</td></tr>
      <tr><td>RIA / IA / CSA</td><td>Research, Innovation, Coordination actions</td><td>Dictate funding rate, partner mix, deliverables.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>GA</td><td>Grant Agreement</td><td>Contract you must sign before receiving money.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>PIC</td><td>Participant Identification Code</td><td>Unlocks all electronic forms.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>SoE</td><td>Seal of Excellence</td><td>Quality label that opens national top‚Äëup schemes.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>TRL</td><td>Technology Readiness Level</td><td>Guides which EIC track or cluster to pick.</td></tr>

  <h2>Quick self‚Äëaudit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I checked my head‚Äëoffice country against the official list (Jan 2025)</li>
    <li>All partners have PIC numbers</li>
    <li>Annex A bookmark lives in my browser for future reference</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="playbook-summary">
    <b>Key takeaway:</b> Eligibility is binary. Run the country test first, grab a PIC immediately after, and the rest of the proposal journey becomes a matter of quality, not legality.
  </div>
  <h2>PIC Registration Guide</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an EU Login account if you don't already have one</li>
    <li>Access the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal and select "Register Organisation"</li>
    <li>Complete the basic information about your organization</li>
    <li>Upload either a VAT certificate or company registry extract (less than 6 months old)</li>
    <li>Submit and wait for your 9-digit PIC (usually immediate, but can take up to 48 hours)</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Programme Matchmaker</h1>
  <h2>Why read this chapter?</h2>
  <p>
    You have a promising concept and a rough timeline, yet dozens of EU programmes compete for your attention. A wrong match steals weeks of drafting time. This chapter walks you through a narrative exercise that filters every option until only one or two calls remain ‚Äî the ones whose success criteria match your current maturity and domain.
  </p>
  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    EU funding looks like a giant buffet table. Horizon Europe alone holds nine thematic clusters, the European Innovation Council opens three separate tracks, Digital Europe sprinkles strategic projects on AI and cybersecurity, LIFE funds green pilots, while InvestEU and CEF throw loans and guarantees into the mix.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beginners often skim the high-level descriptions, latch on to a buzzword, and dive straight into writing. Evaluators then wonder why a climate-mitigation project arrived in a digital-skills call. A disciplined programme-match process flips the script: instead of forcing your idea into the first familiar label, you test it against objective filters ‚Äî readiness, theme, and funding intensity.
  </p>
  <h3>Step 1 ‚Äî Anchor on your maturity, not your ambition</h3>
  <p>
    Ambition drives entrepreneurs, but evaluators award points for evidence. The European Commission expresses evidence through the Technology Readiness Level ladder. Start by asking, "What can we show in the lab or in the field today?" If the answer is a white-paper, you sit near the bottom of the ladder. If the answer is a working pilot at a customer site, you climb to the middle. Anything already generating revenue approaches the top.
  </p>
  <div class="playbook-summary">
    <b>Case:</b> A spin‚Äëout from Haifa University recently discovered this the hard way. They owned an exciting peptide that killed antibiotic‚Äëresistant bacteria in vitro. Believing the solution world‚Äëchanging, they applied directly to the EIC Accelerator. Reviewers loved the science yet failed them on Proof of Market and Traction. Six months later the team rerouted into EIC Transition, coupled the peptide with a clear pre‚Äëclinical plan, and secured 2.3 million euro on the second attempt. The product did not change; the maturity framing did.
